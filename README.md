hi
1. All buttons you need are the side. Click the first 2 to toggle selecting start/end.
2. When done, click "Calculate Routes" button.
3. Checkboxes to add whether or not the relevant info should be used in route calculations (selected = yes, unselected = no)
4. the cursor may be offset on windows. maybe use the bottom right quadrant of the crosshair
5. okay thanks
